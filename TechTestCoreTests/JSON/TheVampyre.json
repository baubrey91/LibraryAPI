    "value": "The Vampyre*, a short gothic novel by John William Polidori, was first published in 1819 and is considered the first modern vampire story. The story features Lord Ruthven, a seductive aristocrat with unnatural powers over men and women, and an insatiable thirst for blood. Polidori's innovative portrayal of the vampire as a Byronic figure is said to have set the template for the modern vampire."
